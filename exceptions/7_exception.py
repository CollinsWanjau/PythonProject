raise NameError('HiThere')
'''
the raise statement allows the programmer to force a specified exception to 
occur
* The sole argument to raise indicates the exception to be raised.This must
    be either an exception instance or an exception class.
* If an exception class is passed, it will be implicitly instantiated by
    calling its constructor with no args.
